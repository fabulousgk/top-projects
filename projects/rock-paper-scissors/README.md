# Rock Paper Scissors

This project recreates a classic game in the console. It iterates over several steps and is meant to practice the use of functions and illustrate the steps to design a complex project.

Then at a later step, we give it a UI and make a nice game. I added a bit of additional content, and give homage to my favorite TV show. Fortunately, at this stage we are expected to Google some things and so can incorporate a bit more into our designs, although we learn about positioning later, I thought I could get away with a bit of it here ðŸ˜—.
