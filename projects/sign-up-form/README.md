# Sign Up Form

This project practices basic form layout and constraint-validation skills. It does not use JS so there is no significant validation. (Using JS to validate the password was optional, but I feel this should wait until we get to the JS Validation lesson.)

One very irritating issue that provided learning was the use of an external font. I generally use font stacks or Google fonts, but this font was really a headache with FOUT until I learned about base64 font loading.
