# Admin dashboard

The final Intermediate HTML and CSS project. Primarily a exercise to practice grid, which means I used it where flex would probably be better. I did sneak a few flexboxes in for nav alignment, grid just did not make sense at all there.

And of course my project is an homage to [Mr. Robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot) which I had been watching when working on this project.
