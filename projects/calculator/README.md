# Calculator

The final project of the Foundations course. This project uses all the skills we have so far to create a working calculator. Because, this is an early project it has pretty much no error checking and lacks elegance, but it is functional and uses only the tools we have learned so far...well mostly.

The UI is inspired by the HP 48GX, which is by far my favorite calculator, an I believe superior to most other calculators available now.
