# Mouse A Sketch

The penultimate project from the foundations course, this project requires DOM manipulation and flexbox. Part of the challenge here is to use flexbox for the grid layout. I really wanted a pure CSS flexbox solution, but I just could not come up a method that did not calculate sizes in JS.
